# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project

## Description

The Nashville Housing Data Project aims to provide a comprehensive dataset and database schema for analyzing housing data in Nashville. This project includes a CSV file (`Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.csv`) for data cleaning and preprocessing and a SQL script (`Nashville_Housing.sql`) for creating the database schema and inserting cleaned data.

## Technologies

- **Data Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Database**: SQL (Structured Query Language)
- **Database Management System**: MySQL or any compatible SQL database

## Details About Use

### Data Cleaning

The `Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.csv` file contains raw housing data for Nashville. This data can be cleaned and preprocessed using any data cleaning tool or language (e.g., Python, R, Excel). The cleaned data is then used to populate the database.

### Database Creation

To set up the database:

1. Install a SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL).
2. Open your SQL client and connect to your database server.
3. Execute the `Nashville_Housing.sql` script to create the database schema and insert the cleaned data.

## Dependencies

- SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL)
- SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver)
- Data cleaning tool (e.g., Python, R, Excel) for preprocessing the CSV file

### Database Query Example

To retrieve a list of all properties and their details, you can run the following query after setting up the database:

```SQL
SELECT 
    property_id,
    address,
    price,
    bedrooms,
    bathrooms,
    square_feet
FROM 
    properties;
```

### Issue or Limitations of the Project

- The raw data may contain inconsistencies and missing values that require thorough cleaning.
- The SQL script assumes a specific schema and may require adjustments for different datasets or additional features.

### Future Features

- Integration with data visualization tools for interactive analysis.
- Additional scripts for automated data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Enhanced queries for more detailed data analysis.

## Instructions for Installation

1. Install a SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL).
2. Clean the raw data in `Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.csv` using a data cleaning tool or language.
3. Open your SQL client and connect to your database server.
4. Execute the `Nashville_Housing.sql` script to create the database schema and insert the cleaned data.
5. Verify the database structure by inspecting the tables and relationships.

## Why Did You Choose Your Technology?

CSV files are a common format for storing raw data due to their simplicity and wide support across various tools. SQL was chosen for its powerful capabilities in managing and querying relational databases. MySQL is a robust and widely used SQL database management system, making it an ideal choice for this project.
